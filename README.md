# Smart-Contract-for-Land-Registry
- The Smart Contract Land Registry is a blockchain-based solution that ensures transparent, secure, and tamper-proof land ownership records. Developed using Solidity on the Ethereum blockchain, this system eliminates the need for intermediaries, reducing fraud and administrative inefficiencies.
- It leverages smart contracts to automate property transactions, enforce ownership rules, and provide a decentralized ledger for verifying land records.
- Key features include immutable property history, secure ownership transfers, and automated dispute resolution. This project aims to revolutionize traditional land registry systems by increasing efficiency, trust, and accessibility.
